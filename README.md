# Probability-Theory-Gambler-s-Ruin-Code
This repository will host the code portion of my Probability Theory class project. It will contain different types of coin flip games where the game is rigged in the "computers favor" and a basic completely fair coin flip game. It will play each type of game several times to collect data from to test against our theoretical calculations.
